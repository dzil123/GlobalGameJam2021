Oops! You just lost all your important files!

Can you FIND the LOST yellow folders in time?

The dark folder is the one you must find,
and the lighter ones are decoys.
Watch out for popups stopping your progress.

Controls:
- Double click a folder to open it
- Up arrow to go back a directory
- Refresh button to restart
